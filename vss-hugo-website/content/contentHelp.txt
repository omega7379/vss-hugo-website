content of the website goes here

to add a file
terminal: ``hugo new [filename]``
ex- hugo new a.md

auto-populates with front-matter/meta-data

to make a file within a new directory
terminal: ``hugo new [directoryName]/[filename]``

while the page is set to ``draft: true``
to view the changes in browser, use the -D flag

2 types of content in hugo
single-pages ^ list-pages

list-page, a page that lists other available pages
by default the "homepage" is a list-page

single-page, a page that displays the actual content

list-pages are auto-made at the root of the content directory
ex- localhost:port/dir1 (works) | localhost:port/dir1/dir2 (DNE)

to make dir2 a list-page
terminal: ``hugo new dir1/dir2/_index.md``

to add content to a list-page, put it into a ``_index.md`` file

in order to simply make content files you must use a theme
